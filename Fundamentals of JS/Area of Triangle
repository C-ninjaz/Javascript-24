-->> Problem statement:
Develop a program to calculate the area of a triangle. The program takes the base and height of a triangle 
as input and calculates the area using the appropriate arithmetic operators for multiplication and division.


Input:-
Base of the triangle: 10
Height of Triangle: 20

Expected Output:-
Area of the triangle: 100

--> Solution:
// You have been provided with lengh and breadth of a right angle triangle triangle
//"You need to find the area of a triangle and store the result in variable answer
// Area of a right angle triangle = 0.5*(length*breadth)

function AreaOfTriangle(num1,num2){
    let answer;
	answer  = 0.5*(num1 * num2);
    return answer;
}
console.log(AreaOfTriangle(2,3));
