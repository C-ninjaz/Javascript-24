Problem statement:

Write a program that converts every character of the user name as lowercase and 
combines the first name and last name of the user.
You have given the first name and last name of the user as the input. 
The names of the users should be stored in lowercase only and the output should be a 
combination of both First name and Last name.

Input:-
firstName: “JOHN”
lastName: “DOE”

Expected Output:-
Username: johndoe

Solution:

function lowerCaseString(str1, str2) {
let answer;
// You have been provided with two input strings as parameters: str1 and str2
// Example: str1 = "JOHN", str2 = "DOE"
// Do not define or assign values to these inputs; they are provided automatically.

// Task:
// 1. Convert str1 and str2 to lowercase.
// 2. Concatenate the two lowercase strings together.
// 3. Store the result in the variable 'answer' below.

// Write your logic here:
let lowerCaseStr1 = str1.toLowerCase();
let lowerCaseStr2 = str2.toLowerCase();
answer = lowerCaseStr1.concat(lowerCaseStr2);
console.log(answer);
return answer; // The final concatenated string will be returned from here.
}
