-->> Problem statement:
Create a simple online shopping discount calculator. The program should take the input for the original price of a product and the discount percentage. It should then calculate and display the final discounted price.


Input:-
Original Value = "50.75"
Discount Percentage = "15.5"
Output:-
Discounted Price = 42.88

-->> Solution:
//Convert the type to numbers
//Calculate the discountedprice
function shoppingDiscountCalculator(originalValue,discountPercentage){
    let answer;
	let a = parseFloat(discountPercentage)/100;
    let b = parseFloat(originalValue) * a;
	answer = parseFloat(originalValue) - b;
    
return answer
    }
console.log(shoppingDiscountCalculator(50.75,15.5));
