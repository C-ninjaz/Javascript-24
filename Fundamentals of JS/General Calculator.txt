-->> Problem statement:
Now build a calculator application, and we have to implement basic arithmetic operations. 
Write a JavaScript program that takes two numbers as input, performs addition, subtraction, multiplication 
and division, and displays the results.

Input:-
num1:20 
num2: 10

Expected Output:-
Addition is: 30
Subtraction is: 10
Multiplication is: 200
Division is: 2

-->> Solution:
function add(num1, num2) {
  let answer;
  answer = parseFloat(num1) + parseFloat(num2);
  return answer;
}
console.log(add(4,3));


//You are given two numbers subtract them and store the result in answer;
function subtract(num1, num2) {
  let answer;
  answer = parseFloat(num1) - parseFloat(num2);
  return answer;
}
console.log(subtract(4,4));

//  You are given two numbers multiply them and store their result in answer;
function multiply(num1, num2) {
  let answer;
  answer = parseFloat(num1) * parseFloat(num2);
  return answer;
}
console.log(multiply(4,2));

//You are given two numbers divide them and store their result in answer
function divide(num1, num2) {
  let answer;
  answer = parseFloat(num1) / parseFloat(num2);
  return answer;
}
console.log(divide(2,2));
