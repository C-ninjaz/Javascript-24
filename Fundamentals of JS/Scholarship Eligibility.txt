-->> Problem Statement:
Create a program to determine whether a student is eligible for an award or not. 
If they are eligible, store true in the answer; otherwise, store false.

To be eligible for the award, a student must meet one of the following criteria:

Scholarship Eligibility: A student scores above 80 in at least two out of three subjects.
Science Fair Participation: A student has a total score of at least 250 across all three subjects.
If a student meets either of the above criteria, they are eligible for the award.

CASE I:

Input:-
English: 77
Maths:   84
Science: 93

Expected Output:-
true

CASE II:

Input:
English: 79
Mathematics: 75
Science: 98

Expected Output:
true

-->> Solution:
function isEligible(mathScore, englishScore, scienceScore) {
  // Check if the student is eligible for a scholarship (at least two subject scores above 80).
    
  let eligibleForScholarship;
    eligibleForScholarship = (mathScore > 80 && englishScore > 80) ||
    						(englishScore > 80 && scienceScore > 80) ||
        					(scienceScore > 80 && mathScore > 80);

  // Check if the student qualifies for the science fair (total score at least 250).
  let qualifiesForScienceFair;
    let totalScore = mathScore+englishScore+scienceScore;
    qualifiesForScienceFair = totalScore >= 250;

  // Determine eligibility for the award (meets either scholarship or science fair criteria).
  let eligibleForAward;
    eligibleForAward = qualifiesForScienceFair || eligibleForScholarship;

      // Return the final eligibility status for the award.
  return eligibleForAward;
}
console.log(isEligible(77,84,93));
