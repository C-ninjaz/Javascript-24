-->> Problem Statement:
You are required to implement a grading system for a school based on the marks obtained by students in a test. 
The goal is to write a JavaScript program that determines the grade of a student using conditional statements.


The grades will be assigned in the result variable based on the following criteria:
1- If the value of the marks variable is greater than or equal to 90, the value of the result variable should be "A grade"
2- If the marks are between 80 and 89, the value of the result variable should be "B grade".
3- If the marks are between 70 and 79, the value of the result variable should be "C grade".
4- If the marks are between 60 and 69, the value of the result variable should be "D grade".
5- If the marks are less than 60, the value of the result variable should be "F grade".


Expected Input
89
Expected Output
B
Expected Input
93
Expected Output
A

-->> Solution:
//Write a program to determine the grade of the student
//Determine the grade and assign it to the result variable.
//Do not alter anything else given in the starter code

function main(marks) {
  let result;
  //write your code here
	if (marks>=90){
        result = "A Grade";
    }
    else if (marks>=80 && marks<=89){
        result = "B Grade";
    }
    else if (marks>=70 && marks<=79){
        result = "C Grade";
    }
    else if (marks>=60 && marks<=69){
        result = "D Grade"
    }
    else if(marks<=60){
        result = "F Grade"
    }
    
  return result;
}
console.log(main(89));
console.log(main(93));
