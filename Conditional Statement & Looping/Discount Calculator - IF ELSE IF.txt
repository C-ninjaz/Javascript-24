-->> Problem statement:
You are developing an online shopping website, and you want to implement a discount system based on the total purchase amount. Write a JavaScript program using if statements 
and operators that calculate and display the total cost after applying a discount. The discount rules are as follows:

a- If the total purchase amount is $100 or more, apply a 10% discount 
b- If the total purchase amount is between $50 (inclusive) and $99.99 (inclusive), apply a 5% discount.
c- If the total purchase amount is less than $50, no discount is applied.


Input
200
Expected Output
180
Explanation
The amount is $200, so a 10% discount is applied: 200 - (200 * 0.10) = 180.

-->> Solution:

function discountCalculator(totalAmount) {
  // a variable to store the final amount after applying the discount
  let answer;
    
  // Check if the total amount is 100 or more to apply a 10% discount
    if (totalAmount >=100)
  // Then subtract the discount value from the total amount to get the answer
    {
        answer = totalAmount - (totalAmount * 0.10);
	}

  // Check if the total amount is between 50 and 99.99 (inclusive) to apply a 5% discount
	else if (totalAmount >=50 && totalAmount <=99.99)
        {
            answer = totalAmount - (totalAmount * 0.05);
        }
  // If the total amount is less than 50, no discount is appliedt
    else if(totalAmount <= 50)
        {
            answer = totalAmount;
  // In this case, the answer should be the same as the total amount
        }

  // Returning the final amount after applying the discount
  return answer;
}
console.log(discountCalculator(200));
console.log(discountCalculator(80));
console.log(discountCalculator(50));
