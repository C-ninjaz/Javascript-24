-->> Problem statement:
Create a Compound Interest program that calculates the total amount accumulated after a certain period based on the 
following attributes:

a. principalAmount: The principal value deposited
b. annualInterestRate: Interest rate per year(expressed as a decimal).
c.  numberOfYears: Period for which interest has to be given. 

Requirements:
1. Calculate the total amount accumulated using the compound interest formula.
2. Do not use toFixed or round off the answer.
3. Use a while loop to calculate the total amount over the specified number of years.
4. Store the final amount in the answer variable. 


Expected Input
principalAmount : 500$
annualInterestRate : 0.08 (8% expressed as a decimal)
numberOfYears : 5
Expected Output
734.66

-->> Solution:
function compoundInterest(principalAmount, annualInterestRate, numberOfYears) {
  let answer;
  
  // Initialize the answer variable with the principal amount
    answer = principalAmount;
  // create and initialize a year counter to 1
	let yearCounter = 1;
  // Use a while loop to calculate the total amount over the specified number of years
  	while (yearCounter<=numberOfYears)
    {
        answer += answer*annualInterestRate;
    	// answer = answer+answer*annualInterestRate;
         yearCounter++;
    }
  // Return the final amount after all years
  return answer;
}
console.log(compoundInterest(500, 0.08, 5));
