-->> Problem statement:
You need to write a JavaScript function that calculates the sum of all prime numbers between 1 and a given upper 
limit 𝑛. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. 
Your task is to store the sum of these prime numbers in the variable answer.

Expected Input
50
Expected Output
328

-->> Solution:
function sumOfPrimeNumbers(limit) {
  let answer = 0; // Variable to store the sum of all prime numbers

  // Iterate through all numbers from 0 to the given limit
 	for(let i = 1; i <= limit; i++)
        {
     // Inside the first loop create a variable to count the number of divisors of i
			let count = 0;
    // Check how many numbers divide i without a remainder by using nested loop
   	for (let j = 1; j<=i; j++)
        {
            if(i % j === 0)
                {
                   count++;
                }
        }
            if(count === 2)
                {
                    answer += i;
                }
    // If count equals 2, then i is a prime number		
 }
  // Return the sum of all prime numbers between 0 and limit
  return answer;
}
console.log(sumOfPrimeNumbers(50));
