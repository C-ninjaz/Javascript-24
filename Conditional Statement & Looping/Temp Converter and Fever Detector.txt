--->> Problem statement
Write a function (already given in the starter code as 'main') to determine if a patient has a fever based 
on their body temperature. The temperature is given in Fahrenheit, and you need to convert it to Celsius 
to make the determination.

Input:-
For an input temperature of 98.6 Fahrenheit, the function should return:
Output:-
You have a fever! Your temperature is 37.0°C.

Test Cases:-
There should be a correctly defined temperature function.

1- Convert the temperature from Fahrenheit (tempF) to Celsius. Use the appropriate conversion formula.
2- Then apply the if condition to check whether the converted value is greater than or equal to 37. 
3- If the Celsius temperature is 37°C or higher, set the result variable to indicate a fever with the temperature rounded to one decimal place.
4- If the Celsius temperature is below 37°C, set the result variable to indicate no fever, with the temperature also rounded to one decimal place.
5- Return the result variable from the function.


--->> Solution:
//Do not alter anything else given in the starter code

function main(tempF) {
  let result;

  // Step 1: Convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
 	let tempC = parseFloat((tempF-32)*5/9);
  // Step 2: Store the converted temperature in a new variable. 
    let newTempC = tempC;
  // Step 3: Check if the rounded temperature is 37°C or higher with the help of if and else condition
    if(newTempC>=37)
        {
            newTempC = newTempC.toFixed(1);
    result = `You have a fever! Your temperature is ${newTempC}°C.`;
        }
    else{
        newTempC = newTempC.toFixed(1);
    result = `You don't have a fever! Your temperature is ${newTempC}°C.`
    }
  // Use the toFixed() method to format converted temperature in celcius to one decimal place.
  return result;
}
console.log(main(50));
