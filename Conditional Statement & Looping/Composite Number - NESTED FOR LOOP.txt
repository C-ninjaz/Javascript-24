-->> Problem statement:
Write a javascript program to check if a number is composite or not. A composite number is a natural 
number or a positive integer that has more than two factors.

Definition:

A composite number is a number that has more than two factors.
A number that is not composite includes prime numbers (which have exactly two factors: 1 and the number itself) and the number 1 (which has only one factor).

Expected Input
20
Expected Output
true
Explanation
20 has factors 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. Since it has more than two factors, it is composite.

-->> Solution:
function Composite(number) {
  let answer; // This variable will store the result (true or false)
	let i;
  // Initialize a variable to count the number of factors
	let factor = 0;
  // Loop through all integers from 1 up to 'number'.
    for(i=1; i<number; i++)
        {
            if(number% i==0)
                {
                    factor++;
                }
        }
    if(factor>2)
        {
            answer = true;
        }
    else{
        answer = false;
    }
    
  // Increment the count for each integer that is a divisor of 'number'.

  // After the loop, check if the count of factors is more than 2

  // Return the result
  return answer;
}
console.log(Composite(20));
console.log(Composite(13));
