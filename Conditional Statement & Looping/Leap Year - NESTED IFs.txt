-->> Problem statement:
Write a program that checks whether a given year is a leap year. The program should follow specific rules to 
determine if a year is a leap year and store the result as a boolean value (true or false) in a variable named answer.

Check the following conditions to check if a given year is a leap year or not:

Condition 1: If a year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
Condition 2: If a year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year.
Condition 3: If a year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year even though it is divisible by 100.

Expected Input
2013
Expected Output
false
Expected Input
2004
Expected Output
true
Expected Input
2100
Expected Output
false

-->> Solution:
function leapYear(year) {
    let answer;
   //Write your code here
    if (year % 4==0)	
        {
            answer = true;
            if (year % 400==0)
                {
                    answer = true;
                }
            else if ( year % 100==0)
                {
                    answer = false;
                }
        }        
    else{
            answer = false;
        }
return answer
}
console.log(leapYear(2013));
console.log(leapYear(2004));
console.log(leapYear(2100));
